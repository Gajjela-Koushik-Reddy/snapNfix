# snapNfix
snapNfix is an Android app is tailored to streamline the process of tracking and managing structural defects across diverse settings, including apartments, construction sites, extensive farms, and industrial areas.

# Features
Documentation of Defects:
The app simplifies the defect documentation Using smartphone's camera, one can swiftly capture images of structural issues, whether it's a cracked wall, faulty equipment, or any other concern.
The defects are documented with:
1. Image of the defect.
2. Location
3. Notes
4. Severity Type
- Geotagging:  
The app automatically tags the exact location where each defect was identified.
- Data Storage:  
    - The app stores all the information on cloud (i.e., firebase)
- Pinning photos on map:  
    - The photos taken on the phone will be shown on the map in their respective
locations.  
- Sharing:
    - (still thinking if the app is not complicated enough – I’ll add this feature) The defects can be shared with multiple people who are responsible for the fixing of the structural problem.
